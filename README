libtim-py: miscellaneous data manipulation utils
================================================

About
=====

This library provides some routines to work with wavefront analysis, which can
be useful for (offline) wavefront sensor data processing.

Created by Tim van Werkhoven (werkhoven@strw.leidenuniv.nl).

Installation
============

This module can be installed using the standard NumPy distutils. Therefore,
simply running

   python setup.py install

will install this module to the default installation location. Running

   python setup.py

Usage
=====

Documentation of routines can be found in the docstrings of the respective 
modules. Also, running doxygen in ./doc will extract the docstrings and present nicely formatted HTML documentation.

Testing
=======

To test this module, simply run

    nosetests

from the root directory, if you have it installed. Otherwise, run the test_*
